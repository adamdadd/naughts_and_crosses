# naughts_and_crosses
An easy to understand C++ "tic tac toe" game (but named properly ;D)

Looking at using this as a basis for running ML (Game Trees) and Quantum Computing scripts in the future. (Watch this space!)

In the meantime it provides endless seconds of fun!

## Install
Enter the following command in terminal
```
make
```
in naughts and crosses directory. Or alternatively use the g++ compiler.

## Run
Run  using:
```
./naughts_and_crosses
```
This will start the game.
